# Week Report 1  

## Progress This Week  
- Created functions for **Miller Rabin Algorithm and Sieve of Erastosthenes**  
- Started working on the function for **Carmichael function** but it is not ready yet and not pushed to the repo. 
- Added **Poetry** and **Pylint**
- Added a logo for the terminal application.  
- Created the **necessary documentation**  

## Time Spent  
I spent approximately **4 hours** on the project this week.  

## Development Status  
Core development is in progress and the key-pair generation algorithm is almost complete.

## Learning Outcomes  
This week, I researched **RSA encryption** and **different algorithms** I need to use in order to create the key-pair. Learned how the RSA keys are generated.

## Challenges and Uncertainties  
I have a question if I use external libraries such as **random** to generate random 1024 bit numbers or do I have to write the number generation function myself. Or what is the policy about using external libraries at all such as **math** to generate gcd or lcm, or other things?

## Next Steps  
Next, I will **finish up the core code and start working on different functionalities**.
