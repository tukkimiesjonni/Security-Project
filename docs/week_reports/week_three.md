# Week Report 3

## Progress This Week  
- This week I did not have as much time to progress my project as I would have liked.
- Created a **gcd, lcm and carmichael totient functions**, but I feel like the carmichael function could be refactored to make it better.  
- Corrected some pylint errors.
- Created the **necessary documentation**  

## Time Spent  
I spent approximately **3 hours** on the project this week.  

## Development Status  
Core is under development but close to being finished. I need to just implement the last step of the key generation process.
Terminal app got some structure.

## Learning Outcomes  
This week, I researched **RSA encryption** and gained a **better understanding of how it works**.  

## Challenges and Uncertainties  
I currently have **no uncertainties**.  

## Next Steps  
Next, I will **finish the core app** and **refine the terminal application**. I also need to write tests for the project.
