# Specification Document  

## Language and Documentation  
I will write the **code, reports, and documentation in English**.  

## Technology Stack  
I will use **Python** for the project. Since it is **terminal-based**, no additional languages are needed.  

## Implementation Plan  
I will implement **RSA encryption** as described in the example task.  

## Research and Development  
I need to **research the functionality** of the program further to provide a precise answer. However, at a minimum, the program must handle:  
- **Key generation**  
- **Encryption and decryption of texts**  
- **Prime number generation**  

## Performance Considerations  
The project should ensure that **most functions operate in** O(log(n)) **time complexity**.  

## Program Structure  
The **core** of my program will handle:  
- RSA encryption  
- Encryption and decryption processes  
- All necessary calculations related to these operations  

Outside the core, there will be:  
- A **terminal-based application**  
- Additional functionalities as needed
